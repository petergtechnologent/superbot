# Text to Flex

A web-based platform that converts a **conversational user input** into a **Flex Spec**, then automatically builds, deploys, and troubleshoots a FastAPI microservice until it’s running successfully on a specified port. The final containerized service can be plugged into the “Flex” system for extended orchestration and usage.
