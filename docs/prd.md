# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. App Overview
**Name**: AI-Powered App Generator  
**Description**: A web-based platform that converts any app idea into a fully functional, deployed application. Through a chat-like interface, users input their concepts, and the AI system autonomously writes, tests, deploys, and troubleshoots code until it’s running successfully.  
**Tagline**: “From Idea to Running App—Automagically.”

## 2. Target Audience & User Personas
- **Primary Users**: Employees at an IT value-added reseller & systems integration company, focusing on:
  - Artificial Intelligence / GenAI  
  - Data Management  
  - Cybersecurity  
  - Digital Automation  
  - Modern Cloud  
  - Service Provider Solutions (XaaS)  
  - Financial Services  
  - Professional Services  
- **Secondary Users**: Prospective customers, partners, and end-clients needing rapid proof-of-concepts (POCs).
- **Goals**:
  - Quickly validate ideas and produce live POCs.
  - Showcase rapid innovation and “wow factor” to impress new or existing clients.
  - Reduce dependency on scarce developer resources.
- **Pain Points**:
  - Limited coding skills among many team members.
  - Uncertainty around deployment and technical setup.
  - Need for real-time logs and transparency into AI processes.

## 3. Key Features
1. **Chat Interface for Ideation**  
   A user-friendly GUI where users enter app ideas (one-liner or detailed).
2. **AI-Driven Code Generation & Troubleshooting**  
   Automatically generates the code, fixes deployment/runtime errors, and redeploys until successful.
3. **Instructional Output**  
   Clear step-by-step instructions on how to run, use, and access the newly created application.
4. **API Accessibility**  
   Expose functionality via an API for integration with other systems or tools.
5. **History & Logging**  
   History tab for past prompts, plus real-time logs for AI activity, deployments, etc.
6. **Security Testing & Checks**  
   Automated scans for potential security risks before deployment.

## 4. Success Metrics
- **POC Turnaround Time**: From prompt to deployed app.
- **User Adoption Rate**: How many employees actively use it.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Feedback from clients about the speed and completeness of POCs.
- **Deployment Success Rate**: Ratio of successful automated deployments vs. errors.

## 5. Assumptions & Risks
- **Assumptions**:
  - Underlying AI models can generate functional code with minimal intervention.
  - Users have machines that can run Docker and Docker Compose (or Kubernetes).
- **Risks**:
  - AI-generated code may have hidden security/performance issues if not checked thoroughly.
  - Users with no coding background might still need minimal guidance.
  - Potential compatibility issues with new or unsupported software/hardware.

## 6. Timeline
- **ASAP / Rapid MVP**: Deliver a functional web-based solution quickly for demos.
- **Future Phases**: Advanced security scanning, optimization, multi-cloud deployment, or mobile support.
