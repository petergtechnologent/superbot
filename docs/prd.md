# Product Requirements Document (PRD)

## 1. App Overview
**Name**: Text to Flex  
**Description**: A platform that takes **conversational user input** and transforms it into a “Flex Spec,” which is used to automatically build and deploy a FastAPI microservice. This final containerized service can be integrated into the Flex ecosystem.

## 2. Target Audience & User Personas
- **Primary Users**: Internal IT integrators and solution architects who need to spin up small, containerized services quickly.
- **Goals**:
  - Drastically reduce development overhead.
  - Allow non-developers to specify service needs in plain English.
  - Integrate easily with the Flex orchestrator system.
- **Pain Points**:
  - Writing code for small microservices is repetitive.
  - Deploying them in a robust pipeline can be complex.
  - Need for quick iteration when errors surface.

## 3. Key Features
1. **Conversational Input → Flex Spec**  
   Users describe their service in plain language. The system calls an LLM to interpret this text and generate a structured specification (port, routes, data sources, etc.).
2. **Automated Code Generation**  
   The spec is handed off to a code generator, which returns Dockerized FastAPI code.
3. **Iterative Deployment**  
   Automatically builds the container, checks logs, fixes errors, and retries until success.
4. **Logging & History**  
   Displays real-time logs and a history of conversation prompts and deployments.

## 4. Success Metrics
- **Time to Working Service**: From user idea to a running container on the designated port.
- **User Adoption**: How often teams switch from manual coding to using Text to Flex.
- **Deployment Success Rate**: Number of successful auto-deploys vs. total attempts.

## 5. Assumptions & Risks
- LLMs can interpret ambiguous user text accurately enough to form a valid spec.
- On-prem or cloud AI usage must remain stable and cost-effective.
- Docker environment is available and safe for repeated container builds.

## 6. Timeline
- **MVP**: Conversational input → single-service generation → deployment with logging.
- **Future Enhancements**: multi-service workflows, advanced error detection, or custom logic for more advanced Flex specs.
